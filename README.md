### Bianca Riebe @biancaann6 and Kaitlyn Manalili @kmanalili

<br> The purpose of this project is to compare observed gravity changes before different earthquakes. 

<br> Introduction: Mulitiple datasets with earthquake and gravity data were analyzed to show how gravity changes directly before different earthquakes. The earthquakes analyzed are the Tohoku-Oki and Sendai Earthquake, Lushan Earthquake, and Wenchuan Earthquake.
