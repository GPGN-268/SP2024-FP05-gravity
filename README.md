## Comparing Gravity Changes Before Earthquakes
### Bianca Riebe @biancaann6 and Kaitlyn Manalili @kmanalili

<br> Problem Objective: The purpose of this project is to compare observed gravity changes before different earthquakes. 

<br> Introduction: Multiple datasets with earthquake and gravity data were analyzed to show how gravity changes directly before different earthquakes. The earthquakes analyzed are the Tohoku-Oki and Sendai Earthquake, Lushan Earthquake, and the Wenchuan Earthquake. 

-Datasets
<br>

-Tools/packages
<br>Pandas(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) We will use pandas to open our data and clean our data.
<br>Numpy(https://numpy.org/) We will use numpy to further analyze and manipulate data. 
<br>Matplotlib(https://matplotlib.org/), we will use matplotlib to make visualizations of our data. This will especially allow us to compare data when we are presenting the outcomes of the project. 

-Plans Methodology/approach
<br>
To approach our project, we found two data sets with gravitational data recorded throughout a range before and after the eathquakes occurance. We plan to use matplot lib to analyze our data for gravitational trends and eventually use matp:lot to produce effective and clear visualizations of how gravity can change before an earthquake. 
<br>
-Expected Outcomes
<br>The Tohoku-Oki earthquake had the largest change in observed gravity before the earthquake, out of the two earthquakes whose data our group will analyze. Both datasets should show that there is a change in observed gravity before large earthquakes.

-Any other relevant info
<br>The group will need to be aware of the data's temporal and spatial resolution. Gravity changes vary across different time scales and spatial ranges, impacting your analysis.
