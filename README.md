## Comparing Gravity Changes Before Earthquakes
### Bianca Riebe @biancaann6 and Kaitlyn Manalili @kmanalili

### Problem Objective

The purpose of this project is to compare observed gravity changes before earthquakes. 

### Introduction

Multiple datasets with earthquake and gravity data were analyzed to show how gravity changes before/after different earthquakes. The earthquakes analyzed are the Tohoku-Oki and Sendai Earthquake, and the Lushan Earthquake. 

### Datasets

[Lushan Data](https://zenodo.org/records/7855090)

[Tohoku-Oki Data](https://www.eas.slu.edu/GGP/tohoku2011/second/)


### Tools/packages

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) We will use pandas to open our data and clean our data.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) We will use numpy to further analyze and manipulate data. 
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), we will use matplotlib to make visualizations of our data. This will especially allow us to compare data when we are presenting the outcomes of the project. 

### Plans Methodology/approach

To approach our project, we found two data sets with gravitational data recorded throughout a range before and after the eathquakes occurance. We plan to use matplot lib to analyze our data for gravitational trends and eventually use matplotlib to produce effective and clear visualizations of how gravity can change before an earthquake. 

### Expected Outcomes

The Tohoku-Oki earthquake had the largest change in observed gravity before the earthquake, out of the two earthquakes whose data our group will analyze. Both datasets should show that there is a change in observed gravity before large earthquakes.

### Challenges

The group will need to be aware of the data's temporal and spatial resolution. Gravity changes vary across different time scales and spatial ranges, impacting your analysis.
