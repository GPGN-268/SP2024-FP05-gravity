## Comparing Gravity Changes Before Earthquakes
### Bianca Riebe @biancaann6 and Kaitlyn Manalili @kmanalili

<br> Problem Objective: The purpose of this project is to compare observed gravity changes before different earthquakes. 

<br> Introduction: Multiple datasets with earthquake and gravity data were analyzed to show how gravity changes directly before different earthquakes. The earthquakes analyzed are the Tohoku-Oki and Sendai Earthquake, Lushan Earthquake, and the Wenchuan Earthquake. 

-Datasets
<br>

-Tools/packages
<br>Pandas(https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) We will use pandas to open our data and clean our data.
Numpy(https://numpy.org/) We will use numpy to further analyze and manipulate data. Matplotlib(https://matplotlib.org/), we will use matplotlib to make visualizations of our data. This will especially allow us to compare data when we are presenting the outcomes of the project. 

-Plans Methodology/approach
<br>
-Expected Outcomes
<br>The Tohoku-Oki earthquake had the largest change in observed gravity before the earthquake, out of the three earthquakes whose data our group will analyze. All three datasets should show that there is a change in observed gravity before large earthquakes.

-Any other relevant info
<br>The group will need to be aware of the data's temporal and spatial resolution. Gravity changes vary across different time scales and spatial ranges, impacting your analysis.
